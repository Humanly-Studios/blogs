Here is a proposed architecture for a local-first tool that uses ZincSearch to process exported Apache Spark Metastore data and answer questions about data lineage:

### Architecture Overview

1. **Export Spark Metastore Data**
   - Export the Apache Spark Metastore metadata (table definitions, column schemas, and lineage if available) into structured files such as JSON or Parquet.
   - This includes details like table names, columns, column data types, relationships, and lineage metadata.

2. **Preprocessing & Data Transformation**
   - Transform the exported metadata into JSON documents suitable for full-text indexing.
   - Extract lineage information as explicit fields or nested documents to allow querying lineage relationships.
   - Normalize/flatten schema information for easier searching.

3. **Local ZincSearch Instance**
   - Run ZincSearch as a single binary locally for simplicity and low resource usage.
   - ZincSearch ingests the preprocessed JSON metadata documents via its Elasticsearch-compatible API.
   - The schema-less design allows flexible indexing of varying metadata fields.

4. **Query Interface**
   - A local web UI or command line tool interacts with ZincSearch’s query API.
   - Users can ask questions using Elasticsearch DSL or keyword search for:
     - Which tables/columns are used by a given dataset?
     - What is the lineage upstream/downstream of a column or table?
     - Metadata such as column data types and descriptions.
   - Query results come directly from ZincSearch's indexed data.

5. **Visualization & Reporting (Optional)**
   - Visualize lineage graphs by interpreting ZincSearch query results or enrich UI with simple lineage maps.
   - Export lineage reports for audits or documentation.

### Benefits of this Architecture

- **Local-first:** ZincSearch runs as a single binary locally without external dependencies.
- **Schema-flexible:** ZincSearch schema-less indexing supports diverse metadata structures.
- **Elasticsearch API compatibility:** Allows use of rich query DSL for lineage/column queries.
- **Easy integration:** Apache Spark Metastore data export and JSON ingestion is straightforward.
- **Lightweight:** ZincSearch requires less setup than full Elasticsearch clusters.
- **Extensible:** Additional lineage or metadata details can be added as the metastore evolves.

### Summary Diagram (Conceptual)

```
Apache Spark Metastore (export JSON) 
           ↓
Preprocessing & Transformation (extract tables/columns/lineage)
           ↓
ZincSearch (local single binary, indexing & search)
           ↓
Query Interface (CLI/Web UI for lineage/column queries)
           ↓
User gets answers about column usage and data lineage
```

This approach leverages ZincSearch's embedded web UI and Elasticsearch-compatible APIs, providing a lean, local-first tool suitable for interactive lineage and schema discovery on Apache Spark exported metastore data using ZincSearch.[1][2][10]
