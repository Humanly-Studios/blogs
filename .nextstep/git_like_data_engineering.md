using a git like approach,  the use of LLM in data engineering is easier (explore)


There are several research papers, articles, and tools that follow a similar approach to Bauplan's paradigm of "Git for Data" and modular versioned pipelines with branching, Write-Audit-Publish patterns, and lakehouse versioning:

- "Git is for Data" paper by Y Low proposes the concept of XetHub, a system that retains the Git user experience and can scale for large datasets, implementing Git-like versioning semantics for data [https://www.cidrdb.org/cidr2023/papers/p43-low.pdf].[1]

- The blog "Git for Data - What, How and Why Now?" on lakeFS explains the benefits of Git-like operations for data engineering, such as branching, isolated development, commits, reverts, and collaborative version control of data [https://lakefs.io/blog/git-for-data/].[2]

- The "Write-Audit-Publish" data engineering pattern is described in detail in a lakeFS blog that discusses how this pattern ensures data quality and trust by writing data to staging, auditing it, then publishing it for consumption [https://lakefs.io/blog/data-engineering-patterns-write-audit-publish/].[3]

- Articles on Apache Iceberg branching and versioning show how lakehouse data management leverages Git-like branching to safely experiment, isolate jobs, backfill, and conduct safe development on data [https://www.starburst.io/blog/iceberg-branching-data-management/].[4]

- A blog by Dagster explains implementing the Write-Audit-Publish software design pattern in ETL pipelines for data reliability and quality [https://dagster.io/blog/python-write-audit-publish].[5]

- AWS blog shows how to build Write-Audit-Publish with Apache Iceberg branching and AWS Glue Data Quality for robust data ingestion and quality validation [https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/build-write-audit-publish-pattern-with-apache-iceberg-branching-and-aws-glue-data-quality/].[6]

- Bauplan itself published a blog on formal semantics of Git-for-Data branching, merging, and rollbacks highlighting how to wrap compute inside versioning and branching semantics to get consistency guarantees [https://www.bauplanlabs.com/post/git-for-data-formal-semantics-part-2-branching-merging-and-rollbacks].[7]

These references show Bauplan is closely aligned with emerging Git-for-Data research, lakehouse versioning, and Write-Audit-Publish design patterns in modern data engineering.
