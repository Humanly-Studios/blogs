I currently don't have an environment that supports running or demonstrating Apache Spark code directly, including Spark SQL and its optimization tools.

However, I can provide you with a code example in Python that demonstrates the overall process you requested, including reading Spark SQL code, explaining the plan, using e-graph tools conceptually for optimization, and generating optimized SQL candidates. You can run this example in your own Spark environment with the necessary dependencies installed.
