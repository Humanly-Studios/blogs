# About This Blog

Welcome to my personal blog! This site is built with Hugo and automatically deployed to GitHub Pages.

## Technical Stack

- **Hugo**: Fast static site generator
- **PaperMod Theme**: Clean and responsive design
- **GitHub Pages**: Free hosting with automatic deployment
- **Podman**: Containerized development environment
- **Task**: Simplified build automation

## Development Workflow

This blog uses a modern development workflow:

1. **Local Development**: Run `task serve` to start the development server
2. **Content Creation**: Use `task new-post` to create new blog posts
3. **Automatic Deployment**: Push to main branch triggers GitHub Actions
4. **No Local Dependencies**: All Hugo operations run in Podman containers
