# Welcome to My Hugo Blog!

This is the first post on my new Hugo blog, deployed automatically to GitHub Pages using Podman containers for local development.

## Features

- **Hugo Static Site Generator**: Fast and flexible
- **GitHub Pages**: Free hosting with automatic deployment
- **Podman Containers**: No local Hugo installation required
- **Task Runner**: Simplified development workflow

## Getting Started

To create a new post, simply run:

```bash
task new-post
```

To start the development server:

```bash
task serve
```

Happy blogging! ðŸš€
